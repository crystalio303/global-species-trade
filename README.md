# A summary of CITES data
CITES tracks legal trade of flora and fauna that are endangered and threatened. Across the world, what types of plants and animals are highly desirable and what parts are taken from them? Live specimens for commercial trade and specimens of predatory birds rank highly.This data is from 2016 and the files for CITES trade have been growing as quickly as that many years.

Countries have an uneven amount of trade recorded. The biggest economies are not prominent in number of trades pointing to lack of global recording of endangered species trade.

The United States has the most recorded trades of participating countries. Its top import is orchids and export is monkeys.

Across the world, captive bred animal and propagated plants that are whole organisms or parts of them are most traded with orchid and cactus plants making up 63% of the family of trades. Family is a taxonomic group two above genus yet still classify many organisms into recognizable categories. CITES still has broad categories that allow types of trade to be categorized in multiple categories like pet trade being personal or commercial and shipping of monkeys for experiments to be classified under commercial instead of scientific. I would like to know what the many monkeys are used for since I hear about virtual rats and simulations that replace animal testing in the US in medicine, a large use for testing. Commercial trade is broad and holds 70% of transactions.

I like the idea of increasing threatened species monitoring through voluntary membership and hopes records become accurate for trade to be regulated in time to spare rare species from overuse.
